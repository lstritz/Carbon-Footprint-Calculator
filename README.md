# Python-Project-S-S
My idea for my project is to create a carbon footprint calculator. I would choose a few factors and base it on carbon emissions data bases. The focus would be mostly on everyday life activities in order to make people think about what changes they could implement. If there will be space and time I was thinking of listing ideas that could be personally changed to get a lower carbon footprint emission.
